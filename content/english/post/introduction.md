Note: If you are reading this post from the home page, clicking into the post itself is required for the Youtube video to appear. I am currently working out a solution to have the video appear on the home page, although I am not sure this is possible with the theme I have chosen. Maybe it will lead me to developing my own theme in the future...

For the purpose of the assignment that I am initially building this site for, I decided that the required video would be best suited here on the introduction post. For the content of the video itself, I chose to go over some of the background information relating to the site's file structure to provide some simple info about how Hugo sites exist and operate.

This video was implemented into the site with [Built-in Shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#use-hugos-built-in-shortcodes) which allows for static and non-static JS code to be embedded easily. For somebody like myself, this is part of what makes using a static-site generator like Hugo so easy to work with and learn about.
