## Preface

I'd like to start off by saying that I consider this 'About' section of my site to be a Work-In-Progress. At the time of me writing this, my life experiences constant change, and I don't see that stopping anytime soon. As time goes on and I continue to work on the site, I expect to develop this section alongside my life.

## About Me

Hi, my name is Michael Ordetx. That's probably pretty obvious given the Hugo theme I selected to fork to build my site around, [Anatole](https://github.com/lxndrblz/anatole), seems to make that known on every page.

I'll try to keep this section short given that my mind tends to wander, but I feel as if no Portfolio site would be complete (not that this site is anywhere near complete) without an 'About Me' section. I like to think that my resume does a good job of showcasing some of my abilities and accomplishments so far, but at the same time there are some more personal details that I so far have excluded from my resume that I'd love to have the chance to talk about online in a more open space for myself.

I've prepared a list that provides some detail about my life and some of my interests, and as I learn more about Markdown syntax and personalization for the css and scss aspects of the theme I forked, I hope that this list can evolve from a simple bullet-style one into something with more enticing formatting. For the time being, the list will have to do.

- Born and raised in Sarasota, Florida
- Previously studied at Florida State University, earning my B.S. in Finance
- Current Florida State Graduate student seeking a Master's in Business Administration
- Currently pursuing the fields of data science/analysis fields in hopes of learning more about my career goals and finding a data-related job
- Major soccer enthusiast who is a life-long FC Barcelona fan (bit of an Arsenal fan too)
- Extremely interested in all things related to technological hardware and components, with a major desire to ultimately work in the consumer tech industry

## About The Site

I want this site to be a place where I can represent myself professionally, but also to serve as somewhere where I am comfortable speaking my mind appropriately. As time goes on and this site develops a greater purpose (or falls apart entirely, who knows), I'd like to continuously mold this section alongside that purpose. For my fellow hobbyists, get excited because the first direction this site is likely to move in will be towards covering some of the ideas I've been holding on to, or just providing a synopsis of my hobbies and how they represent me. At this point, only time will tell, and to any prospective readers, I hope you are just as excited as I am!
